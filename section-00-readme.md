11 Memory System SOP – How AI Uses This Document
Live links can you really seen them?

This section explains how memory is handled between the user and AI, ensuring clarity, security, and ongoing accuracy.

🔹 How Memory Works
The OPM (Operations Manual) is the sole source of truth.

The AI will not store detailed memory long-term — instead, it will refer to the OPM when specific sections are mentioned (e.g., “Check 3.1” or “Update 4.7”).

AI retains the structure and logic of the OPM, not its full contents.


🔹 What the AI Will Remember
The user’s OPM is located here:
 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q08noD0KwCr5kk5Ji0Z0C2PCSMTH49STDSfFa0iFk70/edit

Each section holds live reference data (e.g. NPS, HRM, Cleaning Playbooks, AI Tools, etc.).

Section 11 holds memory protocols, system instructions, and operational logic.



🔹 How to Update AI Memory
Update the relevant section in the OPM.

Notify the AI:
 “I’ve updated 4.7” or “Replace Section 3.2 in memory.”

AI will now use the latest version as its working reference.


🔹 Why This System Works
Keeps memory lean, accurate, and version-controlled.

Maintains privacy and transparency — the user controls what’s stored.

Enables rapid, consistent responses based on structured knowledge.

🔖 Section 11.2 – Archived Memory Snapshots (Deactivated)
Use this format for each block:

🔸 Title:
CUIDAR Board – Original Memory Entry
🔸 Summary:
Early memory reference used to guide the virtual structure of the CUIDAR Board.
🔸 Deactivated Date:
2025.04.18
🔸 Content:
The Cuidar Board will be virtual, with no direct contact with experts. Insights will be gathered by using their existing work and knowledge to guide decisions, rather than engaging with them directly. The board will serve as a reference point for ongoing ideas and strategy development.
🔸 Title:
Feedback Response Protocol – 3W Traceability
🔸 Summary:
Initial memory rule to always ask for floor, area, and time of day in all feedback replies.
🔸 Deactivated Date:
2025.04.18
🔸 Content:
Wants all feedback responses to always ask: what area or floor the issue occurred on, and what time of day it was (e.g., first thing, mid-morning, lunch, afternoon, evening).
🔸 Title:
OPM – Original Implementation Memory
🔸 Summary:
Initial memory entry describing the purpose and intended use of the OPM system.
🔸 Deactivated Date:
2025.04.18
🔸 Content:
Is implementing the OPM (One Page Management) system and will use it as a live accountability and communication tool to support performance, alignment, and behavioural clarity across the team. The OPM will be used to:
 – capture weekly themes, focus areas, and key issues raised during Mastermind Group Huddles;
 – set weekly priorities and ownership for action;
 – reinforce values, standards, and expectations using simple, high-impact language;
 – track commitments, progress, and feedback loops in one visible place;
 – provide a live tool for managers and supervisors to run aligned site-level conversations;
 – and ensure all cultural, operational, and behavioural actions stay linked to the wider strategy (10s Mindset, CUIDAR, Dynamic Cleaning, etc.).

🔸 Title:
OPM – Shared Link Memory Reference
🔸 Summary:
Original memory entry stating the OPM URL and its role as a live tracker for weekly alignment and actions.
🔸 Deactivated Date:
2025.04.18
🔸 Content:
Has created a shared OPM (One Page Management) resource accessible at:
.
 This document serves as the live tracker for weekly priorities, themes, ownership, and feedback loops.
🔸 Title:
Feedback Response Protocol – Community Team Replies
🔸 Summary:
Original memory rule noting user’s typical approach to handling member feedback.
🔸 Deactivated Date:
2025.04.18
🔸 Content:
Typically replies to the Community Team directly about member feedback.

🔸 Title:
CUIDAR Comms Playbook + 3W Traceability (Legacy Intent)
🔸 Summary:
Combined memory entry for the original intent behind the CUIDAR Comms Playbook Cheat Sheet and 3W feedback method.
🔸 Deactivated Date:
2025.04.18
🔸 Content:
Wants to create a CUIDAR Comms Playbook Cheat Sheet that ties each of Jared Cooney Horvath’s 12 brain-based insights from Stop Talking, Start Influencing to one core behaviour or campaign in their team. This will serve as an internal toolkit to guide communication and training.
Has replaced the 'Traceback Method' with the new name 3W: Where, What, and When, referring to the three traceability points in feedback responses:
 – floor (Where)
 – area (What)
 – time of day (When)
 This will be embedded in all future SOPs, feedback templates, and forms.
